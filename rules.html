                    The Rise of the New World is a Virtual Table Top Role-Playing Game (VTT RPG) with elements from Shin Megami Tensei, Persona, and other JRPGs. The game rules are determined by Game Master (Ashton), with the rules written here 2nd in authority, and messages on other mediums like Discord from Ashton to be 3rd in authority.
                    
                    Each player (person at the virtual table) plays as a character, each character can freely describe what they like to do at any given time (within reason). The Game Master (GM) will then determine the outcome of the action, either by narration or by rolling dice. The GM is the final authority on all rules and actions within the game.
                    If a character falls too far from the narrative of the game, the GM may ask the player to change their character or leave the game (You're free to run off and be a rice farmer, but don't expect me to narrate it).
                    <br><br>
                    Your starting character should be, in essence, a self insert. You can alter details like some physical characteristics, names, etc. But they should share your genuine moral beliefs.
                    <br><br>
                    Players will play as humans, becomming demon summoners. You can summon a demon you share a pact with, pacts must be formed by signing contract with demons.
                    The game will have themes of morality, free will, and the nature of humanity.
                    <br><br>
                    Please be mindful of other players, don't interrupt them or the GM, don't hog the spotlight, and don't be disruptive. 
                    <br><br>
                    If a character is killed, the player may create a new character, but the new character starts at the start of the next sesion, the new character will have 95% of the previous character's exp. The character will also have new equipment, skills, demons, etc (written by the player in collaboration with the GM). After the first act of the game ends, players may no longer create new characters on death. If their characters die, they may spectate and play as NPC demons until either the end of the game or their character is revived.

                    The game takes place in the the real world in the current year. The setting is the Biblical apocalypse, with dieties from other religions and mythologies appearing as "demons".
                    A "Demon" is any supernatural being that is not Yahweh, the God of the Bible (with some exceptions). Satan, Zeus, and even angels are collectively referred to as demons.
                    <br><br>
                    The apocalypse occured when "the veil" holding demons in Gehenna finally ripped, there are 5 main factions in the game, each holding their own beliefs for the solution to the apocalypse.
                    Players will start neutral, and will have to choose a faction to side with at the end of the first act. Players may attempt to change their faction at any time, but doing so will have consequences.

                <p class="text-lg text-emerald-100 font-thin mt-2 text-left">
                    When combat starts, the side with the higher total combat speed goes first (coinflip on tie) with battlespeed being determined by the agility of all active demons.
                    During a combat, each side takes turns, having a number of turn press icons equal to the number of active demons on their side. Each turn press icon can be used to perform an action, such as attacking, using a skill, or using an item.
                    Certian actions like passing turn swapping your active demon, or other use a half turn press icon. 
                    <br><br>
                    Using half a turn icon turns the the turn icon into a blinking turn icon, which can be used to perform a full action on the next turn. But if all the turn icons are blinking, using half a turn press icon removes a blinking turn press icon.
                    <br><br>
                    Each player can summon a demon they have a pact with, and can only summon one demon at a time. The demon takes the place of the player, and the player cannot activate skills, take damage, etc, though the player can still swap out their demon.
                    (fractions are roundd down by default).

                    Activating a skill that is not the weapon/default attack consumes MP. Then if it's an attck skill, the skill must be aimed against the target's evasion.

                    Each ailment has a potency, which determines the chance of the ailment being applied. The potency is determined by the skill or item used, and the resistance of the target.
                    When a demon is afflicted with an ailment, they will have a chance to resist the ailment based on their resistance to that ailment.
                    If a demon would be afflicted with an ailment, it must roll to "Will" against it. The "Will" is determined by rolling a d100 and adding the demon's luck, and half the demon's vitality (floored). If the roll is higher than the remaining potency of the ailment, the demon resists it and the ailment does not apply.
